#### Project Description
This project is a simple C++ program that calculates the interest on a credit card’s unpaid balance using the **average daily balance method**.  
The program takes the following inputs from the user:
- Net balance
- Payment amount
- Number of days in the billing cycle (d1)
- Number of days payment is made before the billing cycle (d2)
- Monthly interest rate  

It then calculates:
- **Average Daily Balance** = (netBalance × d1 – payment × d2) / d1  
- **Interest** = averageDailyBalance × monthly interest rate  

The results are displayed with **two decimal places** and include a **thousands separator** for formatting.
